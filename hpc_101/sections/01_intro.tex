        \item \textbf{Login node} -- A specialized node that users connect to in order to submit work to a computer cluster
        \item \textbf{Computer cluster} -- A set of loosely or tightly connected nodes that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system\footnote{\label{wiki_ccluster}\tiny\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster}}
        \item \textbf{Data transfer node (DTN)} -- Specialized nodes that minimize the impedance on the network to access the full capability of the network
	\item \textbf{Science DMZ (SciDMZ)} --  A portion of the network configured with equipment and security policies in order to optimize for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose business systems or “enterprise” computing 
	\item \textbf{Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)} -- An authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence or factors to an authentication mechanism, e.g., DUO
