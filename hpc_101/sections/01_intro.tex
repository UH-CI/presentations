	\begin{itemize}
		\item High Performance Compute
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each separate process can send and receive data amongst other processes (MPI \& OpenMP)
			\item If processes must communicate for the overall program to proceed, high-speed networking is needed (only MPI)
		\end{itemize}
		\item High Throughput Compute
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{Pleasantly Parallel} -- Processes are independent and no communication is necessary 
		\end{itemize}
