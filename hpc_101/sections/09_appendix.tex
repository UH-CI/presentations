	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Node} -- Another name for a server or computer
        \item \textbf{Login node} -- A specialized node that users connect to in order to submit work to a computer cluster
        \item \textbf{Computer cluster} -- A set of loosely or tightly connected nodes that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system\footnote{\label{wiki_ccluster}\tiny\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster}}
        \item \textbf{Data transfer node (DTN)} -- Specialized nodes that minimize the impedance on the network to access the full capability of the network
	\item \textbf{Science DMZ (SciDMZ)} --  A portion of the network configured with equipment and security policies in order to optimize for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose business systems or “enterprise” computing 
	\item \textbf{Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)} -- An authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence or factors to an authentication mechanism, e.g., DUO

	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Symbolic Link (symlink)} -- A file that contains a reference to another file or directory
	\item \textbf{Command-line interface/interpreter (CLI)} -- A text-based user interface used to view and manage computer files 
	\item \textbf{Message Passing Interface (MPI)} -- A standard that is used by programs to pass messages between nodes
	\item \textbf{High Performance Compute (HPC)} -- A computing paradigm in which applications are typically a tightly coupled parallel job that benefit from a low-latency interconnect
	\item \textbf{High Throughput Compute (HTC)} -- A computing paradigm that focuses on the efficient execution of a large number of loosely-coupled tasks
        \item \textbf{Modified time} -- The last time the file was modified (content has been modified)\footnote{\label{Types of timestamps}\tiny\url{https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/2465}}
        \item \textbf{Shell script (script)} -- A computer program designed to be run by a CLI\footnote{\label{Shell script}\tiny\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script}}
%        \item Pleasantly Parallel -- Processes are independent and no communication is necessary
