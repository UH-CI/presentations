\subsection{Login Node Usage Policy}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Login Node Usage Policy}\footnotesize
The login nodes are a shared resource and are the only access to the cluster for hundreds of user and are meant to provide the following functionality for all users: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Providing ssh shell access 
\item Facilitate the transfer files to and from the cluster:\\Globus, sftp, scp, rsync
\item Launching and monitoring SLURM jobs (batch and interactive)
\item Modifying text files with a text editor: vi/vim, emacs, nano
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] If we identify or are notified that a user is running computation on the login nodes, the application will be killed
\item[--] If we determine that a user repeatedly violates the login node policy, even after being warned, the repeat offender can have their cluster account disabled
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lustre Filesystem Purge Policies}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{{\lustre} Filesystem Purge Policies}
Due to users not having any quotas on the {\lustre} filesystem, we need some policy in place which removes older files from the system.  To accomplish this, we have implemented a purge policy.

\begin{itemize}
\item What in \ctilde/lus/ is subject to the purge policy?
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Answer:} Everything but directories.
   \end{itemize}
\item When will my files be purged?
  \begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Answer:} Files greater than or equal to 1 Megabytein size  or are empty (0 bytes) that are 35 days old
    \item \textbf{Answer:} Files between 1 byte and 1 Megabyte in size that are 120 days old
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the age based on?
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Answer:} Age of file is based on creation time
   \end{itemize}
  
%\item How frequently are files for purged?
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Answer:} Taking into account the fill rate of the {\lustre} filesystem, a purge is performend as usage approaches 80\%.
%   \end{itemize}
